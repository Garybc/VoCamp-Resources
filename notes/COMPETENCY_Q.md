## General questions of a hypothetical drone data lake 
- Show me where drones have been flown capturing data, in a given time period?
- Show me drone flights that captured <parameter x> (eg; humidity, temperature, NIR, etc)?
  -- in area(place) w
  -- in area(geo boundary) x 
  -- in time period y
  -- with sensor z
- Show me drone flights that used a specific aircraft
- Show me drone flights that used a specific sensor 


## General Questions of a specific project
- What aircraft was use for this Project(study)?
- What payload set of sensors was used this Project (study)?
- Where can I find the data?
- What format is the data in?
- Does the data have metadata?
- What data products are available (raw, post-processed what- mosaics, point clouds, analytics etc)?
- What general area (places) was the mission flown? (Eg Death Valley CA)
- Show me the flight area(s) where drone flights occured? (Eg Co-ordinates marking middel of the lake surveyed, OR give the geo boundary of what was flown in 1/multipleflights) 
- What time did the science sensor data collection occur?
- What autopilot software/hardware was used?
- How are the sensors positioned on the sUAS?
- Mission profile type (vertical profile vs horizontal survey vs Point of Interest vs Physical Sampling)(enumeration of types)?
- Is there ground truth data and if so what method was used in collecting it?
- When was the sensor last callibrated and with what method?
- Under what flight rules (country) did the missions occur?
- What publications were part of a Project?
- What post-processing (including which software used) was done?
