#Control System discussion
 - Distinguish between Control (real time) and Navigation ("slower")
 - Inherit actuators, control systems, etc from SOSA
 - SOSA doesn't define "control system"
 - A control system could be: actuators, plant(controller), and sensors 
 - Are actuators part of the control system? - yes

##Intentions:
 - Navigation system translates either weigh points (GPS coordinates) or direction commands (P/R/Y) for Controller
 - Information objects: flight plan (comes out of GCS) and flight log (comes out of controller) 
 - GCS could be modeled out further: human/RC handheld/QGC
 - sUAS: decided to be specific for scopes sake: Has:
