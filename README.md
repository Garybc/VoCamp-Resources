# Supporting a Minimal Information Framework for sUAS data
## Selecting and Developing Vocabularies and Ontologies for field data collected with small Unmanned Aircraft Systems

In brief, sUAS (or more colloqually 'drones') are rapidly transforming many industries and particularly changing how researchers are able to capture environmental data.  However, while many components can be borrowed from analogous sectors (manned aircraft, under water gliders, wireless sensor networks, satelites) there are many factors that mean sUAS data needs its own best data management practices.  A crucial step towards developing such is selecting and developing appropriate ontologies and information models for such.  This repository is a communual development environment for this key component in the broader effort to pursue sUAS best data management practices.
